# BadgerChat (with Voice!)

BadgerChat was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Native, Node.js, Wit.AI, and Sketch. It features a versatile chat agent built on React that manages both text and voice inputs, capable of executing various commands like user authentication and message posting. The integration of Wit.AI enhances the system's ability to understand and interpret user intentions from both text and voice inputs. Furthermore, BadgerChat supports real-time interactions by fetching and posting chat messages efficiently, while a custom-built delegation system maintains meticulous control over user sessions and preferences. ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ 

**Please Note:** The speech-to-text transcription and text-to-speech synthesis are just for fun! 

## Setup

Generated using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Furthermore, [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [react-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap) have been installed. **You should *not* re-run the  npm create vite command**. Instead, in this directory, simply run...

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, in a browser, open `localhost:5173`.

### 8. `Create a message/post`

Type along the lines of "create a post", "make a post in union south socials", or "post a message to picnic point pathfinders" should trigger this intent.

Then, when this intent is triggered, the agent will first check if the user is currently logged in.

If the user is logged in and has specified a chatroom name, the agent will *follow up* to collect the title and content of the post. After collecting the title and content, the agent should do a final confirmation with the user. If a user confirms that they would like to create the post, a post will be made in the specified chatroom and the agent should inform the user as such. Otherwise, if the user fails to confirm the posting, the agent will *not* post the message and assure the user that the post has not been made.
